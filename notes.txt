==================================
Mod ideas:
pickaxe alt attack: character skill based power attack that consumes stamina proportional to rock/vein hp and skill level
portal map: use portal opens portal map to set target portal


easy mod? Do this first :)
mushrooms: all mushrooms (red AND yellow) can be used for recipies requiring a mushroom!

approach idea: find in code where crafting of carrot soup occurs and, if possible, when crafting carrot soup, check for red OR yellow mushroom and don't forget to remove it from inventory
maybe crafting or cookingstation ?
easy way out: create new recipe for carrot soup (and serpent stew) with yellow mushrooms
but, how about modifying how the station processes the recipe? if player has no red mushrooms in inventory, modify existing recipe to use yellow mushroom, then restore it

name ideas: Any Mushroom, Any Mushroom Can Be Soup, Any Mushroom Can Be Cooked, All Mushrooms Are Delicious, Any Mushroom In Soup
